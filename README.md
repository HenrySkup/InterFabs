##About

###Introduction
to be written.

###Goals

*platform parts*

- Browser-based CAD
- Browser-based CAM (ie. tool-path computing)
- Browser-based Machine controle

*process (and indicators of success)*

- Browser-centric :: low bar-or-entry, everyone has it, os agnostic etc.
- Run with or without concurrent internet access
- Littlest/Simplest install possible (none, ideally)
- Open-Source
- HTML5 & Javascript based
- Ease of user customization via as many programming languages as is possible (ie. custom tool-path generation scripts, custom g-code/machine code generation scripts, etc.)

*If a three-year-old can use it, and if en engineer wants to use it: we have done out job.*

###Key Points & Theorems
